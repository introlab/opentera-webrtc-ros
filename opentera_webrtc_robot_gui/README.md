# opentera_webrtc_robot_gui

## Description

The GUI is written with Qt 5.12+ and displays stream information (ROS images) from the WebRTC connection. It will utimately be used to display internal robot state, control the microphone and camera usage and enable calling from the robot's side. At the moment, calls are initiated from the web with [opentera-webrtc-teleop-frontend](https://github.com/introlab/opentera-webrtc-teleop-frontend) and sessions are automatically joined.

> The GUI is unfinished at the moment but usable to display basic video streams.
