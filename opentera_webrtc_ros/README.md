# opentera_webrtc_ros

## Installation

The following ROS packages are required:

- roscpp
- cv_bridge
- std_msgs
- sensor_msgs
- [audio_utils](https://github.com/introlab/audio_utils)

## RosStreamBridge

### Description

Implement a ROS node that publish received images and audio as a WebRTC stream.
It also forwards images and audio received on the WebRTC stream to ROS.

#### Subscribes

- ros_image : `sensor_msgs::Image`
- audio_in : `audio_utils::AudioFrame`

#### Advertises

- webrtc_image : `opentera_webrtc_ros::PeerImage`
- webrtc_audio : `opentera_webrtc_ros::PeerAudio`
- audio_mixed : `audio_utils::AudioFrame`

#### Default Parameters

```xml
<rosparam param="is_stand_alone">true</rosparam>
<rosparam param="stream">
  {
    can_send_audio_stream: true,        # Send audio stream to the signaling server
    can_receive_audio_stream: true,     # Receive audio stream from the signaling server
    can_send_video_stream: true,        # Send video stream to the signaling server
    can_receive_video_stream: true,     # Receive video stream from the signaling server
    is_screen_cast: false,        # Is the image source a screen capture?
    needs_denoising: false        # Does the image source needs denoising?
  }
</rosparam>
<rosparam param="signaling">
  {
    server_url: "http://localhost:8080",    # Signaling server URL used in stand_alone mode
    client_name: "streamer",                # Peer name as which to join the room
    room_name: "chat",                      # Room name to join
    room_password: "abc"                    # Room password used in stand alone mode
  }
</rosparam>
```

For usage exemple look at [ros_stream_client.launch](launch/ros_stream_client.launch).

## RosDataChannelBridge

### Description (RosDataChannelBridge)

Implement a ROS node that publish received messages on the WebRTC
data channel. It also forwards messages received on the WebRTC data channel to ROS.

#### Subscribes (RosDataChannelBridge)

- ros_data : `std_msgs::String`

#### Advertises (RosDataChannelBridge)

- webrtc_data : `opentera_webrtc_ros_msgs::PeerData`

#### Default Parameters (RosDataChannelBridge)

```xml
<rosparam param="is_stand_alone" >true</rosparam>
<rosparam param="signaling">
  {
    server_url: "http://localhost:8080",    # Signaling server URL used in stand_alone mode
    client_name: "data_bridge",             # Peer name as which to join the room
    room_name: "chat",                      # Room name to join
    room_password: "abc"                    # Room password used in stand_alone mode
  }
</rosparam>
```

For usage exemple look at [ros_data_channel_client.launch](launch/ros_data_channel_client.launch).

## RosJsonDataHandler

### Decription (RosJsonDataHandler)

Implement a ROS node that dispatch received JSON messages and forward them on the rights topics.

#### Subscribes (RosJsonDataHandler)

- webrtc_data : `opentera_webrtc_ros_msgs::PeerData`

#### Advertises (RosJsonDataHandler)

- cmd_vel : `geometry_msgs::Twist`

#### JSON Format (RosJsonDataHandler)

For usage exemple look at [ros_json_data_handler.launch](launch/ros_json_data_handler.launch).

## libnavigation

### Description (libnavigation)

Shared library for `goal_manager` and `label_manager` to send navigation commands to `move_base` as well as navigation waypoints to `map_image_generator`.
The library is embedded in both nodes, a single instance is not shared.

#### Subscribed topics (libnavigation)

- stop (`std_msgs/Bool`): Signal to cancel all move_base goals.

#### Published topics (libnavigation)

- waypoint_reached (`std_msgs/String`): String of a JSON message containing the ID of the waypoint that has been reached. Used by the frontend to determine when the trajectory has been completed.
- map_image_drawer/remove_goal: (`geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`): Removes a waypoint from the map image
- map_image_drawer/add_goal: (`geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`): Adds a waypoint to the map image

## goal_manager

### Description (goal_manager)

Manages multiple waypoints received by the frontend and sends them to move_base one at a time. This node relies a service provided by the `map_image_generator` package to convert the waypoints from image coordinates to map coordinates.

#### Subscribed topics (goal_manager)

- waypoints (`opentera_webrtc_ros_msgs/Waypoints`): Array of image coordinate waypoints received from the frontend.
- start (`std_msgs/Bool`): Signal to start navigating sequentially to the previously received waypoints.
- All subscribed topics of `libnavigation`

#### Published topics (goal_manager)

- All published topics of `libnavigation`

## labels_manager

### Description (labels_manager)

Manages labels.
The stored labels are dependent on the `map` transform and the database needs to be cleaned if the map changes.
A label represents a name grouped with an associated pose and a description.
This node relies on a service provided by the `map_image_generator` package to convert the labels from image coordinates to map coordinates.
This node can also send a label as a goal to `move_base` by its name.

#### Subscribed topics (labels_manager)

- add_label_simple (`opentera_webrtc_ros_msgs/LabelSimple`): Label received from the frontend.
- remove_label_by_name (`std_msgs/String`): Remove a label by its name
- edit_label_simple (`opentera_webrtc_ros_msgs/LabelSimpleEdit`): Rename or move a label using frontend map coordinates
- navigate_to_label (`std_msgs/String`): Navigate to a label by its name
- All subscribed topics of `libnavigation`

#### Published topics (labels_manager)

- stored_labels (`opentera_webrtc_ros_msgs/LabelArray`): Array of labels currently stored
- stored_labels_text (`std_msgs/String`): JSON message with an array of maps `{name: string, description: string}` labels names and descriptions. Used by the frontend to display a list of labels.
- All published topics of `libnavigation`
