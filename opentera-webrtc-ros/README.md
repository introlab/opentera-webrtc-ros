# Installation

The following ROS packages are required:
* roscpp
* cv_bridge
* std_msgs
* sensor_msgs

Also add the following [repository](https://github.com/introlab/audio_utils) in the catkin workspace src directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/introlab/audio_utils.git --recurse-submodules
```
See https://github.com/introlab/audio_utils for more informations about the dependency and his usage;

# Clone the repository with the submodules in the catkin workspace src directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/introlab/opentera-webrtc-ros.git --recurse-submodules
```

# TODO

Complete the following documentation.


Finally the OpenTera WebRTC native client and its dependencies must have been built with same build type, Debug or
Release as the desired build output.

# RosStreamBridge

## Description

Implement a ROS node that publish received images and audio as a WebRTC stream.
It also forwards images and audio received on the WebRTC stream to ROS.

### Subscribes

* ros_image : `sensor_msgs::Image`

### Advertises

* webrtc_image : `opentera_webrtc_ros::PeerImage`
* webrtc_audio : `opentera_webrtc_ros::PeerAudio`

## Default Parameters

```xml
<rosparam param="is_stand_alone">true</rosparam>
<rosparam param="stream">
  {
    can_send_stream: true,        # Does the node can send stream to the signaling server
    can_receive_stream: true,     # Does the node can receive stream to the signaling server
    is_screen_cast: false,        # Is the image source a screen capture?
    needs_denoising: false        # Does the image source needs denoising?
  }
</rosparam>
<rosparam param="signaling">
  {
    server_url: "http://localhost:8080",    # Signaling server URL
    client_name: "streamer",                # Peer name as which to join the room
    room_name: "chat",                      # Room name to join
    room_password: "abc"                    # Room password
  }
</rosparam>
```
For usage exemple look at [ros_stream_client.launch](launch/ros_stream_client.launch).

# RosDataChannelBridge

## Description

Implement a ROS node that publish received messages on the WebRTC
data channel. It also forwards messages received on the WebRTC data channel to ROS.

### Subscribes

* ros_data : `std_msgs::String`

### Advertises

* webrtc_data : `opentera_webrtc_ros_msgs::PeerData`

## Default Parameters

```xml
<rosparam param="is_stand_alone" >true</rosparam>
<rosparam param="signaling">
  {
    server_url: "http://localhost:8080",    # Signaling server URL
    client_name: "data_bridge",             # Peer name as which to join the room
    room_name: "chat",                      # Room name to join
    room_password: "abc"                    # Room password
  }
</rosparam>
```
For usage exemple look at [ros_data_channel_client.launch](launch/ros_data_channel_client.launch).

# RosJsonDataHandler

## Decription

Implement a ROS node that dispatch received JSON messages and forward them on the rights topics.

### Subscribes

* webrtc_data : `opentera_webrtc_ros_msgs::PeerData`

### Advertises

* cmd_vel : `geometry_msgs::Twist`

## JSON Format (TODO)

For usage exemple look at [ros_json_data_handler.launch](launch/ros_json_data_handler.launch).
